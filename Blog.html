    <legend><h3>Features of Java Explianed</h3></legend>
   
    <p>The prime reason behind creation of Java was to bring portability and security feature into a computer language. 
        Beside these two major features, there were many other features that played an important role in moulding out the 
                            final form of this outstanding language. Those features are :</p>
        <ol type="1" align="left">
            <li><b>Simple</b>:Java is easy to learn and its syntax is quite simple, clean and easy to understand.The confusing and ambiguous concepts of C++ are either left out in Java or they have been re-implemented in a cleaner way.</li><br>
            <li><b>Object Oriented</b>:In java, everything is an object which has some data and behaviour. Java can be easily extended as it is based on Object Model.</li><br>
            <li><b>Robust</b>:Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone codes by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking. But the main areas which Java improved were Memory Management and mishandled Exceptions by introducing automatic Garbage Collector and Exception Handling.</li><br>
            <li><b>Platform Independent</b>:Unlike other programming languages such as C, C++ etc which are compiled into platform specific machines. Java is guaranteed to be write-once, run-anywhere language.
                On compilation Java program is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is platform independent and can be run on any machine, plus this bytecode format also provide security. Any machine with Java Runtime Environment can run Java Programs.</li><br>
            <li><b>Secure</b>:When it comes to security, Java is always the first choice. With java secure features it enable us to develop virus free, temper free system. Java program always runs in Java runtime environment with almost null interaction with system OS, hence it is more secure.</li><br>
            <li><b>Multi Threading</b>:Java multithreading feature makes it possible to write program that can do many tasks simultaneously. Benefit of multithreading is that it utilizes same memory and other resources to execute multiple threads at the same time, like While typing, grammatical errors are checked along.</li><br>
            <li><b>Portable</b>:Java Byte code can be carried to any platform. No implementation dependent features. Everything related to storage is predefined, example: size of primitive data types</li><br>
            <li><b>High Performance</b>:Java is an interpreted language, so it will never be as fast as a compiled language like C or C++. But, Java enables high performance with the use of just-in-time compiler.</li><br>
            <li><b>Distributed</b>:Java is also a distributed language. Programs can be designed to run on computer networks. Java has a special class library for communicating using TCP/IP protocols. Creating network connections is very much easy in Java as compared to C/C++.</li><br>
            <li><b>Architectural Neutral</b>:Compiler generates bytecodes, which have nothing to do with a particular computer architecture, hence a Java program is easy to intrepret on any machine.</li><br>

    <legend><b><h3>What is Java?</h3></b></legend>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java is an object-oriented, class-based programming language with a focus on minimizing implementation dependencies. It is designed to allow application developers to write once and execute anywhere (WORA), 
        which &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means that compiled Java code can run without the requirement for recompilation on all systems that accept Java. For the development of desktop, web, and mobile applications, Java was initially made 
        available in 1995. Java &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a popular option for enterprise-level applications because of its reputation for simplicity, robustness, and security features.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Gosling created JAVA at Sun Microsystems Inc. in 1995, and Oracle Corporation eventually bought the company. The programming language is straightforward. Programming is simple to write, compile, and debug with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java. 
        It supports the development of modular programs and reusable code. Java is an object-oriented, class-based programming language that is intended to have a minimal amount of implementation dependencies. 
       A compiled &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;general-purpose programming language designed for developers to write once and run anywhere All platforms that support Java can run Java code. 
       To create byte code that can be executed on any Java Virtual Machine, Java &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications are compiled. Java's syntax is comparable to that of C/C++.</p>

    <legend><h3>What is Full Stack Developer?</h3></legend>
    <p>Full Stack Development refers to the development of both front end(client side) and back end(server side) portions of web application.</p>
    <p>Web developers with a full stack
        Complete online apps and websites can be designed by full stack web developers. They work on online applications' or websites'
        front end, back end, databases, and debugging.</p>

    <p>Innovations in Full Stack Development Technology
        Front-end Programming
        The user experience is determined by what is seen on a website or web application. The web application or website's front end is directly manipulated by the user.
        <br><br>
        <font size="4"><b>Front-end Technologies:</b></font>The following languages are used in the development of the front end portion:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Diffrent Frameworks</li>
        </ul>


        <p>It describes the server-side development of a website or online application with an emphasis mostly on the functionality of the website. It is in charge of using client-side commands to manage the database using queries and APIs. The front end, back end, and database are the three essential components of this kind of website.
            The following libraries, frameworks, and languages are used in the development of the back end portion:</p>

        <font size="4"><b>Back-end Technologies:</b></font>The following languages are used in the development of the Back end portion:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>C/C++</li>
            <li>Node js</li>
            <li>Database
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL(Structured Query Language)</li>
                    <li>MongoDB</li>
                </ul>
